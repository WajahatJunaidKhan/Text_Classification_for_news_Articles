# Text_Classification_for_news_Articles

Technologies Used: NLP (BERT, RoBERTa), Python, Machine Learning, Web Development
Contributed to the development of a system for categorizing news articles into predefined categories such as politics, sports, technology, and entertainment.
Implemented transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to classify text with high accuracy.
Assisted in data preprocessing tasks, including tokenization, text normalization, and handling imbalanced datasets.
Participated in model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, ensuring robust model performance.
Collaborated in designing a user-friendly interface allowing users to upload articles and receive categorized outputs.
Worked with the team to ensure integration with content management systems (CMS) and supported continuous improvement through user feedback loops.
